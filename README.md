# 💰 Expense Tracker

A simple and responsive **Expense Tracker** web application built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)**. This tool allows users to record, categorize, and track their personal financial transactions, with real-time balance updates and persistent storage using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ **Add Transactions** – Enter a description, amount, type (income/expense), and date.
- 💸 **Dynamic Calculations** – Automatically updates your total balance, income, and expenses.
- 🗃 **Transaction History** – Displays a list of all income and expense entries with the option to delete.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Data is saved in the browser’s localStorage, so transactions remain after refresh.
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and form inputs
- **CSS3** – Layout, styling, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic, form validation, and event handling
- **DOM Manipulation** – Dynamically updates the UI based on user actions
- **LocalStorage API** – Stores transactions locally for persistence

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users fill in the form with a transaction description, amount, type, and date.
2. On submission:
   - A new transaction is created and added to the list.
   - The balance, income, and expenses are recalculated and displayed.
   - The transaction is saved to `localStorage`.
3. Users can remove any transaction by clicking the “×” delete button.
4. The app initializes and loads all saved transactions every time the page is refreshed.
